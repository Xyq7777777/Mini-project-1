# EC 601 Mini Project 1：Tweet4Like

For the owner of the restaurants, they can simply type in the name of their restaurants and then get the result of liking judgement based on comments on Twitter. The input name of the restaurant and “number of tweets to handle” can be determined by users which enable a more flexible option. Therefore, they can easily know how many tweets are liking their restaurant and the percentage of it. This may help to improve their service, menu, dishes. Customers may conceive the improvement when visiting next time.

## User stories

 I, the owner of restaurants, would like to know the current popular choice of food or drinks (what kinds of products should be released).
 I, the owner of restaurants, would like to know the comments (like, dislike, suggestions) on my store from customers.
 I, the owner of restaurants, would like to know which marketing strategies (promotions, advertisements, discounts, events) will have the most posistive reflect.

## How to build your system

Our design is consist of Twitter API for developers and python codes. The API helps us grab tweets with specific terms on Twitter. The python codes enable us to reorder the tweets and then analyze it. The results can be shown on the terminal for users.


## Running the tests

## Lessons Learned

### Yaqun Xia




### Yi-Wei Chen
I was doing Module 2 which is related to the analysis of grabbed tweets. In this process, I learned how to accomplish the job using python. To be specific, how to read lines in txt files, how to search specific terms in lines, how to make a correct judgement based on keys. These stratagies are new to me which I was learning by doing. The part I think could be better is that I should use the existing tools, namely, Google API to help me do the judgement for it is already built and is with higher accuracy than my code. This caused by not having a full exploring to current tools available. Another thing could be done better is that we did not develop an user interface which may cause the difficulty of using for general users. This is caused by not having enough experience of application development. To conclude, this is the first time for me using Github to complete a group project which I found is convenient for projects in teamwork. Throughout the discussion with my teammate, we eventually built a small system by ourselves from none which is a great accomplish in my point of view. The experience and lessons learned from this mini-project could be my motivation to start the next one.
